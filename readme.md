## by Ahmed Maher


## Dataset

> This dataset includes COVID-19 cases per day and total cases and other information which may help us to find any relation between variable or What's going on across the different continent
source has 30116 rows after removing nulls value before nulls it was(31074 rows).
this date from 2019-12-31 to 2020-07-18

## Summary of Findings

> we can see that Africa has the lowest life_expectancy where Europ has the highest life_expectancy
>it seems Asia has 50% of the total population on the earth so I expect to see they have 40% to 50% of total cases
>the trend line for new cases per day looks like the trend line for new deaths per day which lead us to say . The higher new cases per day , the higher death per da

>However, Africa has the lowest life_expectancy 64.44 and located on number 3 according to the large population it has the lowest total cases and lowest deaths comparing with other continents except Oceania. Also, Africa has the lowest new cases per day and the lowest new death which is weird Africa has warm weather comparing with another country. maybe the weather play a role in the spread of the COVID-19 or maybe something else

## Key Insights for Presentation

> relationship between continent and total cases , total deaths 
> relationship between new_cases per day and new_deaths
> relationship between continent and their life expecatancy aganist total deaths
